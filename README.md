# Interactive Story Game

This is a simple text-based interactive story game built using Python. The game allows the player to make choices that influence the outcome of the story.

## How It Works

The game starts with a story prompt, and the player is asked to make a choice (e.g., 1 or 2). Based on the player's choice, the story continues down different paths until a conclusion is reached.

The different paths use Tree Node data structure to traverse the story.
